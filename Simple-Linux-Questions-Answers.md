* What Unix/Linux commands will alter a files ownership, files permissions?
```shell
	$ chown options owner-user:owner-group file/directory
```
* What does ```chmod +x FILENAME```do?
		* ``+x`` means we are adding file execution permission for all user, group and others
* What does the permission 0750 on a file mean? or What does the permission 0750 on a directory mean?
```
	->	1st bit(0) sticky-bit (This bit is commonly set to directories and means that you may only remove file in such a directory that are owned by you. The filesystem /tmp is commonly set with that bit)
	->	2nd bit(7) file-owner may read(4) + write(2) + execute(1) file
	->	3rd bit(5) file-group may read(4) and execute(1) file
	->	4th bit(0) other-user can't do anything with this file
```
* How to add a new system user without login permissions?
```shell
	# create system user without home directory
	$ adduser --system --no-create-home
```
* How to add/remove a group from a user?
```shell
	$ usermod -G "" username
```
* What is a bash alias?
	* Bash allows us to create our own shortcuts and time-savers through the use of aliases and shell functions. e.g. ```$ alias alias_name="command_to_run"```
* How do you set the mail address of the root/a user?
	* Simply create /root/.forward and place your email address in this file. It will be forwarded to your external mail address. ```myaddress@example.com, root@thisserver.com ```
* What does CTRL-c do?
	* ```Ctrl + C``` is used to kill a process with signal ```SIGINT``` , by other words it is a polite kill . ```Ctrl + Z``` is used to suspend a process by sending it the signal ```SIGSTOP```.
* What is in /etc/services?
	* The configuration file /etc/services maps port numbers to named services. Key point: Its role in life is so that programs can do a ```getportbyname()``` sockets call in their code in order to get what port they should use.
* How to redirect STDOUT and STDERR in bash? (> /dev/null 2>&1)
	* The file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
	```shell
			1>filename
			# Redirect stdout to file "filename."
			1>>filename
			# Redirect and append stdout to file "filename."
			2>filename
			# Redirect stderr to file "filename."
			2>>filename
			# Redirect and append stderr to file "filename."
			&>filename
			# Redirect both stdout and stderr to file "filename."
			2>&1
			# Redirects stderr to stdout.
	```
* What is the difference between UNIX and Linux.
	* Linux is an open source, free to use operating system widely used for computer hardware and software, game development, tablet PCS, mainframes etc. Unix is an operating system commonly used in internet servers, workstations and PCs by Solaris, Intel, HP etc.
	*	Linux kernel is developed by the community. Linus Torvalds oversees things. hree bigest distributions are Solaris (Oracle), AIX (IBM) & HP-UX Hewlett Packard. And Apple Makes OSX, an unix based os.
	*	e.g. Linux : Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat, Debian, Archlinux, Android etc.	UNIX : HP-UX, IBM AIX, Sun Solairs, Mac OS X, IRIX
* What is the difference between Telnet and SSH?
	* SSH and Telnet commonly serves the same purpose
	* SSH and Telnet runs on port 22 and 23 respectively
	* SSH is more secure compared to Telnet
	* SSH encrypts the data while Telnet sends data in plain text
	* SSH uses a public key for authentication while Telnet does not use any authentication
	* SSH adds a bit more overhead to the bandwidth compared to Telnet
	* Telnet has been all but replaced by SSH in almost all uses
* Explain the three load averages and what do they indicate
	```shell
	$ uptime
	20:29	up 34 days, 11:04, 5 users, load averages: 1.05, 0.7, 5.09

	# load average over the last 1 minute: 1.05
	# load average over the last 5 minutes: 0.7
	# load average over the last 15 minutes: 5.09

	# In case assume you have single-core proecessor then pridiction is like this
	# over the last 1 minute: The computer was overloaded by 5% on average. On average, .05 processes were waiting for the CPU. (1.05)
	# over the last 5 minutes: The CPU idled for 30% of the time. (0.70)
	# over the last 15 minutes: The computer was overloaded by 409% on average. On average, 4.09 processes were waiting for the CPU. (5.09)
	```
* Can you name a lower-case letter that is not a valid option for GNU ```ls```?
	* lower-case letter ```z``` is not a valid option for GNU e.g.

	usage: ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]
	```
