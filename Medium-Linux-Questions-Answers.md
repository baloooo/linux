# Medium Linux Questions

* What do the following commands do and how would you use them?
* ```tee``` : command is used to store and view (both at the same time) the output of any other command.
```shell
   ls -1 *.txt | wc -l | tee count.txt
   # In this example the `ls` command lists all files in the current directory that have the filename extension .txt, one file per line; this output is piped to `wc`, which counts the lines and outputs the number; this output is piped to tee, which writes the output to the terminal, and writes the same information to the file "count.txt".
```
* ```awk``` : Short for "Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan," It was designed to execute complex pattern-matching operations on streams of textual data. It makes heavy use of strings, associative arrays, and regular expressions, and is immensely useful for parsing system data and generating automatic reports.
```shell
    $ awk 'length($0) > 72' text.txt 
    # Print only lines of the file text.txt that are longer than 72 characters.
    $ awk '{ print $2, $1 }' data.txt
    # Print first two fields of data in oppeosite order.
```
* ```tr``` : The tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters.
```shell
    $ tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" < file1
    # Translates file1 content lowercase to uppercase
```
* ```cut``` : Remove or "cut out" sections of each line of a file or files.
```shell
    $ cut -f 1 -d ':' /etc/passwd
    # which will display username of all user in system
```
* ```tac``` : Concatenate and print files in reverse. reverse of cat
* ```curl``` : curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The command is designed to work without user interaction. 
```shell
    # Fetch the file index.html from www.domain.com using the HTTP protocol, and redirect data into index.html local file
    $ curl http://www.domain.com/index.html > index.html
```
* ```wget``` : wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.
```shell
    # To download the file http://website.com/files/file.zip into local current directory.
    $ wget http://website.com/files/file.zip
```
* ```watch``` : watch is used to run any designated command at regular intervals. It highlight text which changed as compare to previous output.
```shell
    # which exectue "df -h" command every 10 seconds and highlight difference
    $ watch -d -n 10 df -h
```
* ```head``` : head, by default, prints the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.
* ```tail``` : tail, by default, prints the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. ```tail -f file.txt``` will display last lines of file and execute and update output periodically.
* What does an ```&``` after a command do?
* What does ```& disown``` after a command do?
* What is a packet filter and how does it work?
> Packet filtering is a firewall technique used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, protocols and ports.

* What is Virtual Memory?
* What is swap and what is it used for?
* What is an A record, an NS record, a PTR record, a CNAME record, an MX record?
```A record ```: Address record, Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host
```NS record ```: Name server record, Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers.
```PTR record ```: Pointer record, Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups.
```CNAME ```: Canonical name record, Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name.
```MXRecord```: Mail exchange record, Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain
* Are there any other RRs and what are they used for?
* What is a Split-Horizon DNS?
> Split DNS is a concept that allows a hostname to resolve to one IP address on the internal network, and another on the external network.Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be accomplished with hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to DNS zone records. The latter is a common feature of many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf. Comparison of DNS server software) and is sometimes the implied meaning of the term split-horizon DNS, since all other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server software.
* What is the sticky bit?
> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/79395/how-does-the-sticky-bit-work
* What does the immutable bit do to a file?
> used with ```chattr``` command. A file with the +i attribute cannot be modified.
It cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be written to the file.  When set, prevents, even the superuser, from erasing or changing the contents of the file.
* What is the difference between hardlinks and symlinks? What happens when you remove the source to a symlink/hardlink?
> Underneath the file system files are represented by inodes (or is it multiple inodes not sure)
A file in the file system is basically a link to an inode.
A hard link then just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode.
When you delete a file it removes one link to the underlying inode. The inode is only deleted (or deletable/over-writable) when all links to the inode have been deleted.
A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system.
Once a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.
Note: Hard links are only valid within the same File System. Symbolic links can span file systems as they are simply the name of another file.
* What is an inode and what fields are stored in an inode?
> The inode is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a filesystem object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block location(s) of the objects data. Filesystem object attributes may include metadata (times of last change,[2] access, modification), as well as owner and permission data.
